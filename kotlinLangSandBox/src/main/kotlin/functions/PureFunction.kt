//What is pure function?
//-- Give same input , function always provide same output
//-- Execute does not cause observable side-effects
//** Basiclly means no class field counter, it always provide same output
//** Because we do not want to count the state
//-- Referential Transparency
//** Basiclly just look up table just for mapping values to values
//   That is what the FUNCTION is
// -- Why we should refactor to functional?
//Answer  as goal
// -> Write less code
// ->Write more express code
// -> Showing intent rather than implementation
// -> Aim for correctness
// -> Performance -> Because Silicon Vallay,
// -> It is functional programming, it will scale!!
